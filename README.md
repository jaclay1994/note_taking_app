## note_taking_app

## Description

Allowing user to create, save and delete notes, note_taking_app allows the user to keep track and manage their personal notes. The application is designed to run in the browser and also has a mobile friendly design for those on the go.

## Progress

This application can create, save and delete notes, however when deleting a note or notes, you must refresh the page to see the result of the deletion. I will work on fixing this issue however this app has reached mvp.
